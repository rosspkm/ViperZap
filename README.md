# ViperZAP

ViperZAP is a Javascript interpreted language, with a react client that can parse code on your browser!


## File Structure
The two main folders of the project are: 'web' and 'jzap'. '/jzap' is where all the code for the ZAP interpreter is hosted, while '/web' is where all the code for the react client functionality is hosted. The interaction between the two components was made using yarn workspaces.
